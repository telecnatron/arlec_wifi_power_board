Arlec Wifi Controlled Powerboard
================================
  * Presently available from Bunnings: https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-grid-connect-smart-4-outlet-powerboard_p0161023

  * Needs to be set up using an android app. Rob DIO did this for me as I couldn't get it running on my phone.

  * The device then tries to 'call home' so needs to be blocked at the firewall.

  * Python3 code to control the device.
